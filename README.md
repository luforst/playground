Repository for any experimental/nonsense/fun(?) stuff of mine

The files are sorted into subfolders by their respective programming language.

## Python 3
- caesarcode.py: simple implementation of the Caesar cipher
- collatz.py: check a number for compliance with the Collatz conjecture
- helloworld_boxes_pack.py: I tried a hello-world example of Gtk using the gi module
- josephus.py: a script to solve the Josephus problem, I don't know if it's actually working...
- simple_example.py: Hello-world of Gtk (gi module) with a button changing its label
- stalinsort.py: implementation of the Stalin sorting algorithm: any dissident element rejecting the Party's official order of elements is eliminated
- størmer_numbers.py: well it prints Størmer numbers
- wxpython-beispiel.py: a German hello-world of wxpython

## Shellscript
All of these shellscripts are bash scripts.
- update-license-date.sh: doesn't work yet, but for the future it is supposed to update the year in LICENSE files
- fork-bomb.sh: Now for the fun part! A fork bomb consisting of nothing but punctuation marks
### dialog
These scripts use the dialog command to show a progress bar
- dialog9.sh: does nothing, but pretends to show a progress bar of a backup into the cloud
- documents-backup.sh: compresses the files of Documents folder and shows a progress bar of compression.
  Maybe I'm going to use it in an automatic backup script in the future.
- dvdcopy-gaugedemo.sh: actually it doesn't copy DVDs but pretends to, showing a sample progress bar
